        <h3>About this course</h3>
        <p>
            i made this course simply as i feel that most toki pona courses do not focus enough on context. as toki pona
            is a heavily context-dependent language, ignoring the need to teach context often leads to situations like
            this:
        <blockquote>
            would it be appropriate to make a Toki Pona phrase for the genre "shoegaze" that would be "lukin len noka"?
            or should you just pronounce it like "sukes"
        </blockquote>
        alternatively, not teaching the minimalism aspect of toki pona well leads to situations like this:
        <blockquote>
            I want to use as much words as possible (without it sounding unnatural) to say...
        </blockquote>
        (both of those quotes come from conversations i've been in)
        <br><br>the issue with these is that toki pona is designed from the ground up for you to REDUCE the complexity
        of your speech and thoughts, yet both of these have tried to do the opposite, or have just ignored this concept.
        this course aims to heavily focus on teaching this aspect of toki pona.

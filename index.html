        <h3>About this course</h3>
        i made this course simply as i feel that most toki pona courses do not focus enough on context. as toki pona
        is a heavily context-dependent language, ignoring the need to teach context often leads to situations like
        this:
        <blockquote>
            would it be appropriate to make a Toki Pona phrase for the genre "shoegaze" that would be "lukin len noka"?
            or should you just pronounce it like "sukes"
        </blockquote>
        alternatively, not teaching the minimalism aspect of toki pona well leads to situations like this:
        <blockquote>
            I want to use as much words as possible (without it sounding unnatural) to say...
        </blockquote>
        (both of those quotes come from conversations i've been in)
        <br><br>the issue with these is that toki pona is designed from the ground up for you to REDUCE the complexity
        of your speech and thoughts, yet both of these have tried to do the opposite, or have just ignored this concept.
        this course aims to heavily focus on teaching this aspect of toki pona.
        <h3>"I don't like this course, or your focus on context"</h3>
        fair enough! not everyone speaks toki pona the same way, and its important to find what works for you!
        <br>some alternative amazing resources are:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuYLhuXt4HrQwIDV7FBkA8zApw0pnEJrX">jan Misali's new
                    (uncomplete as of writing) video course</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuYLhuXt4HrQIv3xnDxZqRaLfmxB2U5rJ">jan Misali's old
                    video course; what i personally used to learn toki pona!</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://devurandom.xyz/tokipona/">devurandom's text-based course, available in English, German,
                    Esperanto, German, and Russian</a></li>
        </ul>
        each of these courses focus on something different; jan Misali focuses on being entertaining, and devurandom
        focuses on teaching you how different people speak the language.
        <br>my course instead focuses on teaching toki pona the way <b>i</b> feel it should be spoken. i've found that
        these courses lack teaching context the way i feel it should be taught.

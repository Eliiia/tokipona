            <br><br>if you already know what toki pona is and a few background details about it, you can likely skip
            this lesson and continue onto the next one :)

            <br><br>toki pona is a constructed language (like others, such as Esperanto, Hebrew, and Interslavic) -
            however, unlike most, its goal is not to aid in communication, its goal is far more philosophical.
            <br>its biggest selling point is the word count - 120-150, depending on who you ask; but more frequently
            lands on 137, nowadays. however, please dont let this fool you; while the biggest challenge in language
            learning is indeed memorising vocabulary, toki pona's philosophy makes learning the language much harder
            than appears.
            <br>we will go over this philosophy in the second chapter; usefully, titled "is toki pona for you?"!

            <br><br>the language was first made in 2001, and properly "published" by Sonja Lang in 2014, with the
            release of
            the first toki pona book "Toki Pona: The Language of Good", which is often referred to as "pu". Since,
            another book has been released (in 2021), titled "Toki Pona Dictionary", called "ku" in the community.

            <br><br>toki pona derives its root words from English, Tok Pisin, Finnish, Georgian, Dutch, Acadian
            French, Esperanto, Serbo-Croatian, and Chinese, with the following languages only having one derived from:
            Welsh, Tongan, Akan, and Swahili.
            <br>the language has often been compared to a pidgin language; its minimalist nature, and focus on the core
            aspects of communication as well as limited phonology, help it achieve this sort of feel!

            <br><br>i personally find the language absolutely fascinating, and the community amazing; and i hope you
            feel the same way after this course! :)
